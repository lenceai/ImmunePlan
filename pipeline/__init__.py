ImmunePlan Pipeline — Building Reliable AI Systems

10-step pipeline following the book's reliability framework:
  01 Setup        (Ch 1)    → Config, model download, GPU check
  02 Baseline     (Ch 2)    → Prompt engineering baseline test
  03 Collect Data (Ch 3-4)  → Download papers, extract, chunk
  04 Build RAG    (Ch 3-4)  → Vector store, embeddings, retrieval
  05 Fine-Tune    (Ch 5)    → Adaptive training (auto GPU selection)
  06 Test Model   (Ch 5)    → Test fine-tuned vs baseline
  07 Build Agent  (Ch 6-7)  → Agent with tools, memory, MCP
  08 Evaluate     (Ch 9)    → Hallucination metrics, quality, red team
  09 Safety       (Ch 11)   → PII, bias, responsible AI testing
  10 Deploy       (Ch 10)   → API with monitoring, dashboards
